### Moxtel

This is a mock application I created to prepare myself for interviews.

The application fetches a list of movie details from an online source and displays them in a grid.
When you click on a movie in the grid, it opens the details screen, which also shows some movies of
similar genres.

Key features:

- Clean Architecture & MVVM
- Coroutines & Flow
- Jetpack Compose & Navigation
- Room as the single source of truth
- Unit Tests
- UI Tests
- Hilt for Dependency Injection
